# TyBlog

This site is my first foray into webdev (other than simple html files) and serves the purpose of giving me a platform to document my journey as a developer! I will probably be writing short posts for this site simply to keep up with my personal projects and what technolgies I might be interested in at any moment.

## Technologies

This project uses Svelte for the frontend and is hosted on Firebase. I chose Svelte because it seemed like the most beginner-friendly frontend framework as well as being ranked among the most loved frameworks in the State of JavaScript survey. I chose Firebase because even though there are a lot of other options available, Firebase's free-tier is incredible.
