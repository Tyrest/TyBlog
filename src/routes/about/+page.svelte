	<h1>About this Blog</h1>

	<p>
		This is my first web app. Its built with <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and hosted on Firebase.
	</p>

	<p>
		I just wanted to build something that I could use to both document my journey as a developer and
		learn more about web developement as a whole. I chose Svelte because I had heard good things about
		the ease of use and the performance of the framework. This is my first foray into Svelte and webdev
		as a whole so this blog will most likely be a permanent work in progress.
