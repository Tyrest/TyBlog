	<h1>About this Blog</h1>

	<p>
		This is my first web app built with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a>.
	</p>

	<!-- <pre>npm create svelte@latest</pre> -->

	<p>
		I just wanted to build something that I could use to both document my journey as a developer and
		learn more about web developement as a whole. I chose Svelte because I had heard good things about
		the ease of use and the performance of the framework. This is my first foray into Svelte and webdev
		as a whole so this blog will most likely be a permanent work in progress.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="/sverdle">Sverdle</a> page illustrates SvelteKit's data loading and form handling. Try
		using it with JavaScript disabled!
